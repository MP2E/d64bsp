BSP was originally written by Colin Reed. It was based on ideas from the Doom
specs, by Matt Fell <msfell@aol.com>, and objects.c from the DEU v5 source
code, by Raphael Quinet <Raphael.Quinet@eed.ericsson.se>.

It was later maintained by Lee Killough, who added support for some special
effects, worked a lot on the visplanes problem, and did various optimisations.

Since v5, BSP is maintained by Colin Phipps (cph@cph.demon.co.uk).

Also the following people have also contributed to the development of BSP:

Mark Harrison <harrison@lclark.edu>  - for finding a bug in 1.1x
Jan Van der Veken - finding the invisible barrier bug
Simon "fraggle" Howard <sdh300@ecs.soton.ac.uk> - compressed blockmap code
Oliver Kraus <olikraus@yahoo.com> - big endian support and bug fixes
Jonathan Campbell <joncamp@tiac.net> - bug fixes
Andre Majorel - original Linux port, and other stuff
Udo Munk <um@compuserve.com> - portability improvements and testing
